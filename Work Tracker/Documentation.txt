an application that tracks your work done, 
this might be used as a personal work tracking application 
as there might be some data specific to a piece of work that might not be needed to track on the level the piece of work is.
This should be regared as seperate from the work logs as work logs is time spent on a piece of work. 
This should be maybe regared as a more detailed break down of a work log but not a direct link to a specific work log.
