This application is here to track your time worked on an part\piece of work
- application (data) could be like excel worksheet file in current folder.
- idea to maybe work directly on the excel file for a database or data store like.

View or pages
- logging view : to select client or project, enter description of work then having start and end buttons
- summary view 
- reporting view : 
	> hours logged per month, per week, per client or project
	> non RFS logged work
	
Planning : 
- Business Class to read the xls files 
- UI will have a list of files to select from and to add or even maybe to change the folder where this application stores its xls files.
